Intro
Arthur Samuel (1959) - Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the
ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.  Wrote a checkers program
back in 1959.
Tom Mitchell (1998): Well-posed Learning Problem:  A computer program is said to
learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure
P if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E
